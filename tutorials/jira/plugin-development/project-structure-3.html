        <p class="intro">
            The <a href="plugin-skeleton-1.html">project is ready </a>,
and <a href="how-to-integrate-ide-2.html">IntelliJ can open it</a>. It's time to go
through the project's files and
customize the plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
    Look at the project's structure
</p>
<p>
    <img src="../../../img/blog/3/jira-plugin-structure-min.jpg" alt="Jira plugin Structure">
</p>
<p>
    If you're familiar with Maven, then you're home. The project looks like every other Maven
    project.
</p>

<p>
    The most important file is <strong>pom.xm</strong>. It describes the build process. We're going
    to start with
    this one. We already customized part of it (groupId, artifactId and version). Now it's a good
    time to change the organization details and plugin description. The changes will be visible in
    the
    <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/about-the-universal-plugin-manager-305759439.html">UPM</a>.
    You can also remove dependencies which we don't use (atlassian-plugins-osgi-testrunner, gson).
    From maven-jira-plugin we should remove com.sunrayapps.jira.plugin.ri.api. We do not plan to
    export API.
</p>

<p>The last property in the file we would like to configure is jira.version. We're going to support
    <strong>Jira 7.1+</strong> (Jira versions which active support). It's a good practice to use the
    lowest Jira version here. It'll help us to be compatible with the oldest version. It's always
    easier to achieve forward compatibility. It may be even impossible to backport changes to the
    older version. For example, in case we use a new API that doesn't exist in the older one. If
    you're going to create plugin only for private use, then you can set your current Jira version.
</p>

<p>
    Now we can remove generated component and interface (MyPluginComponent and
    MyPluginComponentImpl). And all the tests. We don't need them. After all the changes applied,
    you may have to reimport maven setting in your idea.
</p>
<p>
    Rerun our customized plugin and check if it works. In case of problems, it may be necessary to
    clean the project before 'atlas-debug'. This time the script downloads Jira 7.1.0 war.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/michalgh/08464855b790e4dec0cfe49caa29a718.js"></script>

<p>
    This time the script downloads Jira 7.1.0 war. The next most crucial file is
    "atlassian-plugin.xml". It contains information about the plugin. For example, name,
    description, icons, and plugin's key. The key needs to be unique globally and immutable. You
    can't change it after a release. You also cant share it with another plugin. By default, it's
    groupId plus artifactId.
    The file also describes resources provided by the plugin. We're going to go into details later.
    Variables like ${project.description} are injected from pom.xml. You can use here any property
    defined in the pom file.
</p>

<p>
    As you probably notice, we have two plugins with the same name running. We also have two
    "atlassian-plugin.xml" files. We don't need the one that is in the test package. The one is an
    example of <a
        href="https://developer.atlassian.com/server/framework/atlassian-sdk/run-wired-tests-with-the-plugin-test-console/">wired-tests</a>.
    We don't use it now and don't plan to use it in the foreseeable future. It can be removed.
</p>

<p>
    It's worth to mention
    <a href="https://github.com/SunrayApps/jira-recurring-issues/blob/master/LICENSE">LICENSE</a>
    file. It is there to remind you, that it's important to choose a
    license for your add-on. Usually, I change the license in one of the first commits, then I don't
    have to remember about it. If you prefer to do the things at the last moment, remember to change
    it before the release.
</p>

<p>
    The last file is
    <a href="https://github.com/SunrayApps/jira-recurring-issues/blob/master/README">README</a>
    describes some of Atlassian's SDK commands. We already used atlas-debug
    to run the plugin (link to the first blog post). At the end of the file, you can find a link to
    the documentation.

</p>

<p>
    The project also contains icon, logo, CSS and js and i18n file. I'm going to cover it later in
    this tutorial. Next time we're going to
    <a href="jira-integration-points-4.html">
    find an entry point for our plugin.
